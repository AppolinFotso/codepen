          <p title="paragraph-one">
            I have a true passion for technology. When I was a little boy, I
            used to repair broken electronic devices especially radios because
            they were one of the most used and affordable devices at that time.
            But after obtaining my baccalaureat, I did something different from
            my passion because of circumstances and reality of life that the
            majority of people faced in Africa. But my passion is still driving
            me and I am motivated to learn as much as I can so that I can work
            as a software developer one day and teach others who are also
            passionate to learn. I am truly exited about learning how to code
            and ready to face all the challenges that come with it. I want to
            join Code Your Future firstly, because I want to become a
            Professional Web Developer building websites and web applications.
            Also, I want to help others to understand web technology. Secondly,
            because Code Your Future boosted my confidence and gave me the
            opportunity to believe in myself again which is a huge motivation
            for me to learn more about web technology. Additionally, I would
            like to become a professional developer because I have passion for
            technology, I like creativity and I like to positively impact other
            people lives. When I look at a well designed website or a web
            application, I often ask myself how creative and fun it must be for
            someone to have the practical knowledge to build websites or web
            applications, I want to be that person that is the reason I believe
            Code Your Future is the right place for me to become a professional
            developer and hopefully create my own company in the future.
            Furthermore, I am a hardworking, flexible and adaptable person. I am
            motivated to complete this course because I have chosen this as my
            profession and I will put all the effort, time, and energy to
            achieve my dream profession.
